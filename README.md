# Deep-Learning-Specialization

I took the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/ZQK4QYAJBD6A) course on Coursera conducted by my favourite instructor, [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng). This has been one of the best courses I have taken on deep learning. Anyone who is interested to take a deep dive in this field can have a look at this course. It will impart necessary knowledge and ideas so that you can kickstart your own deep learning project! 

This course also has well designed Programming and Lab assignments.
